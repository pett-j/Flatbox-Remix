# Flatbox remix
This is a remix of the Flatbox cases by jfedor and fits the rev4 or rev5 PCB without modification.

Parts required for a full assembly:
- 1x case
- 1x bottom plate
- 12x choc v1 compatible buttons (1 big, 11 small), I recommend the Bridget buttons from SGFDevices<br>
  **Please keep in mind that the caps will be flush with the top of the case once depressed**
- 7x M3x6 countersunk screws<br>

- 6x 12mm rubber feet/bumpons - The extrusion is 0.6mm x 12.6mm<br>

- 6x A56 caps for option buttons for 6x6x7 or 6x6x8 round head tactile push buttons<br>

Depending on your printer and settings, you can print all parts without supports.<br>

I recomended supports with bottom plate for the feet extrusions, and the USB-C port on the case can also use some with the bridge, but this isn't required.
