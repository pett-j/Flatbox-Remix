# Flatbox rev5 case remix
This is a remix of the Flatbox rev5 case by jfedor and fits the rev5 PCB without modification.

Parts required for a full assembly:
- 1 case
- 1 plate
- 7 M3x6 countersunk screws
- 6 12mm rubber feet/bumpons
- 6 6x6x7 or 6x6x8 round head tactile push buttons
- 6 A56 caps for option buttons
- 12 choc v1 compatible buttons (1 big, 11 small), I recomend the Bridget buttons from SGFDevices
