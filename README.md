# Flatbox rev5 remix
This is a remix of the Flatbox rev5 case by jfedor and fits the rev5 PCB without modification.

Parts required for a full assembly:
- 1x case
- 1x bottom plate
- 12x choc v1 compatible buttons (1 big, 11 small), I recommend the Bridget buttons from SGFDevices
- 7x M3x6 countersunk screws
- 6x 12mm rubber feet/bumpons<br>

- 6x A56 caps for option buttons for 6x6x7 or 6x6x8 round head tactile push buttons<br>

Depedning on your printer and settings, you can print all parts without supports.
To help with printing the slot for the USB-C port on the case, some can be used with the bridge, but this isn't required.
It is also suggested to use some supports with bottom plate for the recesses.
